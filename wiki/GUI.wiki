#summary Overview of the GUI package and how it works

= Introduction =

The GUI for the Phase 10 project is composed of six independent frames and one Manager class, called GuiManager. The GuiManager class contains an object for each frame and is linked with the GameManager class doubly so as to allow communication between the managers in both directions. GameManager also contains an object for each Frame.
